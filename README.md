# Wiki WAM Log
_(WAM = Wiki Activity Monitor)_

This is project for demonstration WAM score for some FANDOM wikis I edited in 2016-2020. 
WAM score ranges from 0 to 100 (higher â€” better) and represents different wiki metrics (exact combination of them is unknown).
In 2021 WAM was removed from FANDOM but old data still exists.

Created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [recharts](https://recharts.org).

Project archived and moved to *[main page repo](https://github.com/DoubleCookies/DoubleCookies.github.io)*.
