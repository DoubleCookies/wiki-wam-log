# Wiki WAM Log
Small project for demonstration WAM score for some wikis I edited in 2016-2020. 
This score from 0 to 100 (higher - better) represented different wiki metrics (exact combination of them is unknown).
In 2021 WAM was removed from FANDOM wikis... and I guess it's OK.

Created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Launch
In root folder you should type
- `yarn install`  (for installing packages)
